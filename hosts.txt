# Sample MPI hostfile for multi-node execution
# Format: hostname slots=number_of_processes
#
# This file specifies which nodes to use and how many MPI processes
# each node should run. Adjust the hostnames and slot counts based
# on your actual cluster configuration.

# Example configuration for 4 nodes with different capabilities:
node1 slots=4
node2 slots=4  
node3 slots=8
node4 slots=8

# Total slots: 24 processes
# Usage example: ./run_workflow_mpi.sh -p 24 --hostfile hosts.txt

# Alternative format (if you don't want to specify slots):
# node1
# node2
# node3
# node4
# (MPI will distribute processes evenly)

# For localhost testing with multiple processes:
# localhost slots=8
